_"In programming, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve"_

Hello! I'm an ardent software developer with an interest in **Full Stack Development**, **Data Science & Visualization**, and **Computer Vision**.

I'm pursuing a **Master of Science** in **Computer Science** at **Stony Brook University**. Currently, I'm a **Machine Learning Intern** at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/).

<!-- I'm interested in studying **Data Visualization** , **Operating Systems** and **Computer Vision**! -->

I have served as the **Lead Fullstack Developer Intern** at [Talentserve](https://www.talentserve.org/), where I engineered robust dashboards leveraging Django to facilitate smooth engagement between over **100,000 students and a vast network of 1,000+ companies**. During my undergraduate studies, I have served as a Research Assistant on projects involving [detection of problematic lyrics in popular music](assets/pdf/272.pdf){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} and [diagnosis of COVID-19 using CNNs](assets/pdf/Covid19_Paper.pdf){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}. _Check out my [projects â†—](projects/)._
